# Overview
This is an MCP server for searching any static site indexed with `pagefind`. It's all Node.js

# Code Principles
* Simple to run via npx: Find to use dependencies, but only one process, etc.
* Use beacon comments: Every block of code should have a short 3-5 word beacon comment describing what the block does

# Contributing
* Always run tests (`npm test`) before committing
